The newspaper you are reading, the pencil you use to fill in a Sudoku box, the battery,
that makes your wristwatch tick at this very moment -- these are all the achievements of the Age of Enlightenment.

The Enlightenment was not just some historical epoch that no longer touches us, but still leaves its
traces everywhere. Medical discoveries, electrical appliances and the social-democratic social system all stem from it.

For Enlightenment is not a fixed period that simply ends after a certain time.
Since the beginning of the Enlightenment in 1720, it has been an ongoing process.
For humanity, the Enlightenment is a blessing: There are almost infinite examples of what the Enlightenment has 
improved for humanity. Be it in matters of technology or ethics.
We adorn ourselves with the Enlightenment and its results up to now, but every every medal has a flip side.

The Enlightenment is no exception.

For if one is honest, one must also mention things like nuclear weapons, systematic genocides, warships and goods.
Although many inventions were intended to protect humanity and preserve life, misuse can never be ruled out.
But it is wrong to condemn the entire Enlightenment and the independent thinking of mankind for this, 
since in the end man alone is responsible for his deeds?

Responsibility is the key word -- every progress, every achievement brings with it new responsibility and it is up to us to live up to it.
The more society structures itself and the more inventions there are, the more the more the responsibility of mankind grows.

But what if we cannot bear it? Is our technology then already more enlightened than our mind?
And why do some people not want to bear this responsibility? Or can they not?

For example, the contradiction between enlightenment and the church, or religion in general, remains open.
Despite all modernity, religion forces people back to an outdated way of living and thinking.
They fly around the world in a jumbo jet or into space with NASA and still claim that there is someone who owns the world.
who owns the world and rules over it. How can we live in such a developed world of the 21st century
and look for our role models in the time of 2000 years ago?

Why do people today laugh at the naivety of the Germanic peoples with regard to their nature gods, when we are basically doing the same?
do? Why does man's intellect, which is so well-developed, need the belief that he is not alone, not without a god?
And is it not precisely faith that keeps us from evolving?

If one holds to the thesis that there is one or even several gods, why then should mankind move to
to change anything in the world? God has the last word anyway and all our achievements would be
unimportant. If we are all eternal, what are we living for?

Everything we do would be insignificant because it has no effect. It is only through our limited lifetime that our
our actions make sense. Because what we do will have its effects.
Our actions may not last forever, but a long time, however we cannot.

Or are some people just too comfortable to bother with enlightenment? Are they so entrenched in their
religion or in their tradition that anything new only frightens them and it would be far too exhausting to think about new
new things on their own? But should the Enlightenment then be forced on them?
And is it even in the spirit of the Enlightenment to force the Enlightenment on people?

Who decides when one is enlightened and when one is not?
And who gets to decide what is positive about enlightenment and what is negative?
Or is it up to each individual to decide?

Max Frisch once said: "If you had the power to order what seems right to you today, you would order it,
against the opposition of the majority? Yes or no." And, would you? Is it enlightened to impose an opinion on people?
If you think about the intentions of the Enlightenment, it is not.

And right after that he asked the counter question: why not, if it seems right to you? Yes, why not? Because the
Because then the individual has to decide: Does he live together with unenlightened people and remain alone with his conception of the
enlightenment or does he force them to enlightenment in order to spread it and end up with a dictatorship that is opposed to enlightenment?

In the end, enlightenment also remains only a relative concept that is shaped by people. Just like love,
friendship and trust, it cannot be defined. And through coercion, the Enlightenment would have no future.
have any future. For enlightenment is a matter of minds and views.

If one does not stand behind them, they are meaningless. 
One must find his enlightenment himself, because he must be able to live with it and also die with it.

A curse and a blessing at the same time.
