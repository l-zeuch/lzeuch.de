Hey there! My name is Luca Zeuch, a programming enthusiast and spare time tutor from Germany.

Currently I study chemistry at the University of Bremen.

Outside of code, I enjoy cooking, swimming, reading, and playing Badminton. I like learning new stuff and forgetting it
almost immediately.

## About This Blog

This blog/website serves as a personal dump for various things; though mostly you'll find essays about topics I find
intresting, whenever I find the time and motivation to write them ðŸ‘€.

My writing skills aren't the best, but I hope that I can improve them over time and share my way of thinking about...
stuff with anyone who visits my humble website!

school education, as well as some HTML/CSS.
